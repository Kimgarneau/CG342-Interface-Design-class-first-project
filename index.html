            <h2 id="bio"> About Sydney </h2>
            <p> Sydney Magrane is my favorite artist, animator, and my best friend. 
                She is super cool and i am so happy that i never get any time away from her since we're in the same classes and live together. 
                She is so skilled and makes classic and unforgettable characters, such as Priscilla Pigeon. We enjoy many activities together, such as making chai lattes,
             playing magic the gathering on the dorm carpet, and crying in the bathroom together. She is quite bad at using chop sticks, but her baby chop sticks help her conquer any food. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="button-alert" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a></p>

        <h3 id="cat"> Miss Daisy</h3>
<p> Miss Daisy is Sydney's cat. She is so cute and chonky and im so glad i got the pleasure of meeting her once. She spends most of her time napping on Sydneys bed. She meows a lot when Sydneys on facetime but its never a bother. Miss Daisy has severe anxiety and is very displeased when Sydney leaves home to go to school.
    She enjoys purring, puff toys, and purina salmon pate. "10/10 would pet again" - Sydney<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/757650958095351809/1078776701368139876/DBD14745-BAA3-40C9-BFC9-F76C0C0CFB82.jpg" class="button-alert" target="_blank"> See Miss Daisy here</a></p>

        <h4 id="pets">Sydneys other pets</h4>
        <p> Miss Daisy isnt the only cute furry member of Sydneys family. There is also her three dogs, Cassie, Leo, and Winston. Cassie is a husky mix who loves to spend her days catching birds and digging giant holes in Sydneys backyard. Although shaped like a sausage, her stubby physique has never held her back. She loves bread and long walks.
            Leo has a satggering 3:1 leg to body ratio. He is a very good boy and enjoys spending his nights curled up like a donut on the couch. He is a big fan of old people, because they remind him of his grandma and grandpa, and he has an extreme wiggle habit when he gets excited.
        Winston is a funky boy. He has a snaggletooth that chronically sticks out and his tail is way too long. He also steals immense amount of cuddles from every other family member... one could call him a cuddle thief. When he isn't biting Cassie's feet, he's dodging Leo's weird play invitations and butt sniffs. He is very well behaved!  </p>

    its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is
    impossible. </p>-->

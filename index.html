            <h2> About Sydney </h2>
            <p> Sydney Magrane is my favorite artist, animator, and my best friend. 
                She is super cool and i am so happy that i never get any time away from her since we're in the same classes and live together. 
                She is so skilled and makes classic and unforgettable characters, such as Priscilla Pigeon. We enjoy many activities together, such as making chai lattes,
             playing magic the gathering on the dorm carpet, and crying in the bathroom together. She is quite bad at using chop sticks, but her baby chop sticks help her conquer any food. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="button-links" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a></p>

<p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
    its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is
    impossible. </p>-->
